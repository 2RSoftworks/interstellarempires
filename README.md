Interstellar Empires
===================

Free, open-source continous multiplayer Real-Time-Strategy game on a big scale. Powered by Java, Scala, LibGDX and Kryonet. It is hackable, moddable and freely playable at [empires.lonelyrobot.io]().

The game was originally developed from 2012 â€“ 2015 and was abandoned due to missing motivation and resources. In the spring of 2017 development was started again, initially focusing on refactoring and cleaning the codebase.

## About this Game

The game is an MMO Real Time Strategy game where players take control of a colony in deep space, take action and make decisions for their people to advance their colony and extend their empire to the stars.

Inspired by early 2000's browser games Interstellar Empires has a focus on macro-scale fleet and economic gameplay. Low level descisions are automated through self-programmable AI in forms of Admirals and Managers while the player is left to develop their strategy in terms of warfare and diplomacy to conquer the stars.

The wiki is currently under re-development but will soon hold more articles about the gameplay.

## Additional Information

The project is currently in a re-structure phase which means that much of the old documentation is out of date and invalid. This README will be updated in the future to reflect changes being made.
