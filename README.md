Interstellar Empires
===================

Interstellar Empires is a game concept by ***REMOVED*** and Leander Sabel and being produced by Random Robot Softworks under the lead of ***REMOVED*** (SpaceKookie).

The game is an MMO Real Time Strategy game where players take control of a colony in deep space, take action and make decisions for their people to advance their colony and extend their empire to the stars.

The game is structured into different phases that make it easier to integrate into a continuous world that is populated by player driven but also NPC driven content.

# About this repository
The game is open source, free to play and mod with and will always stay this way.
At some point we will start hosting servers and will appreciate donations to keep them running. And we might even offer premium copies of the game to buy to support us and the development. But the game will remain open source.

If you want to have a look at what we’re currently working on, why don’t you head over to the `releases` tab and see what’s new. Please note that everything filed under “pre-release” is exactly that: PRE-RELEASE and still heavily under construction.

# About the Game
Here is a little summary about what the game will be like. More infos can be found in the `wiki`

## Stage I
A new player spawns in the world and takes control of a single colony with their mothership orbiting around it. They now have 2 weeks of immunity from other players. In that time they discover what the game is about, how to do certain things, manage planetary interactions and even spread to different celestial bodies (planets, moons, asteroids and asteroid belts, etc.) in their starting solar system.
The game is being made interesting by a number pirate attacks that originate from an outpost in the system.
Stage I ends either when the player successfully defeated their pirate base and got ultimate control over their star system or after a 2 week counter has run up.
After that, Stage II begins.

## Stage II
After Stage I the player is thrown into the world of PvP where players fight massive wars over territories to expand their empires. Because old players would dominate the new there is a limit on how many game points a player needs to be attackable by someone else. A player will always be able to attack upwards but only be able to attack players that have at least ⅓ the game points of themselves. This way in Stage II a lot of skirmish wars start to happen. Players are usually by themselves, plotting strategies and expanding their empires.
They start to create diplomatic networks or turn into ruthless dictators that burn everything in their way.
There is no exact transition between Stage II and Stage III

## Stage III
At some point players will reach a state where they start joining or creating alliances with other players. Alliances have similar rules to bullying the weak so can not be used to drive new players out of the game and be easy prey.
With time alliances can either merge or fight terrible wars with chemical, biological and drone warfare.
This is the last stage of the game that either lasts until the entire galaxy is dominated by a single player (very unlikely) or a player is completely destroyed (slightly more likely).

Giving up and stopping to play the game is not an option! We will find you! Wherever you are, we will find you. And we wills trap you to a chair and force you play this game.
We will find you...!
